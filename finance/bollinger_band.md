# Bollinger Band

Developed by John Bollinger, the Bollinger Band shows the price of the stock with an upper and lower band (standard deviation) shown alongside a 21-day simple moving average.

Standard Deviation is a model of volatility, which means that a larger volatility is presented with a larger band (more room for growth, but equally for loss) and a smaller band means less volatile.

## Oversold & Overbought

Some people believe that as the price of the stock moves to the upper band, the more overbought the market is. Contrarily, the more it moves to the lower band, the more oversold the market is.

## The Squeeze

When the bands contract, this is called a squeeze. This means a period of lower volatility, which many take as a signal for a future of increased volatility and trading opportunities.

When the bands move further apart, there is a larger risk for them to move apart again and may be a good time to exit a trade.

These conditions are not trading signals. They don't indicate when the change will take place, or the direction they'll move.

## The math

Bollinger Bands consist of:

- an N-period moving average (MA)
- an upper band at K times an N-period standard deviation above the moving average (MA + Kσ)
- a lower band at K times an N-period standard deviation below the moving average (MA − Kσ)

Typical values for N and K are 20 and 2, respectively.

Other averages can be used, such as the exponential moving average.

## Effectiveness

A 2007 study that spanned from 1995 to 2005 showed no evidence of consistent performance over the standard "buy and hold" approach, but a "contrarian Bollinger Band" (reversal of the strategy) yielded positive results.

The band may be more effective in Chinese markets.
